ME210SumoBot
============

CAD files for an ME210 (Intro to Mechatronics) project

The robot is designed to autonomously push competing robots off a small platform.
Drivetrain is via stepper motors, and sensing is mainly via infrared transistors. (Brains = Arduino)

Not quite sure what else to write here. I'm being unconventional and using git to host Solidworks files

Also being worked on by fberg@stanford.
